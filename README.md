here are my experiments. 
I decided to make a state-machine-tokenizer (in `lang-simple.bqn`).
Currently tokenizing Strings, variables, nesting, and comments.
the rest, whatever that may be, is non-existant.

The scrapped mathy files are experiments from a while ago, trying to use array-style parsing. Unsuccessful, but i made some progress, and I don't remember how much.
